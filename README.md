As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

* `department`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold department name

* `role`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `title`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold role title

    * `salary`: `DECIMAL` to hold role salary

    * `department_id`: `INT` to hold reference to department role belongs to

* `employee`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `first_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee first name

    * `last_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee last name

    * `role_id`: `INT` to hold reference to employee role

    * `manager_id`: `INT` to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (`null` if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a `seeds.sql` file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.

## Bonus

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* Update employee managers.

* View employees by manager.

* View employees by department.

* Delete departments, roles, and employees.

* View the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.


## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
